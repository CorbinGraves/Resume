        <p class="Synopsis">My background gives me a unique mix of leadership and design knowledge that has proven to be an asset to my work. I started my career as an art educator designing in-person and virtual experiences and events, focusing on the needs and ultimate goals of my students and the communities I served. These experiences have honed my skills in building empathy and creating connections between diverse people, teaching students and adults. I discovered that I had a passion for UX/UI design.
